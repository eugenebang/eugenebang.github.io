DeepMind has unveiled [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/), a **unifying DNA sequence model** that advances regulatory variant-effect prediction and promises to illuminate the function of the human genome—now available via API for non-commercial research.

#### 🔍 Why it matters
The genome is our cellular instruction manual, but deciphering how its instructions are read—and how small DNA variations affect biology—remains one of science’s deepest challenges. Variants in non-coding regions, which make up 98% of the genome, play critical roles in orchestrating gene activity and disease susceptibility.

AlphaGenome aims to address this, predicting how single variants or mutations impact a wide range of biological processes regulating genes with higher resolution than before.

#### ⚙️ How AlphaGenome works
AlphaGenome can process long DNA sequences (up to 1 million base-pairs) and predict thousands of molecular properties, including:

🔹 Gene start and end sites across tissues\\
🔹 RNA production levels\\
🔹 DNA accessibility, proximity, and protein binding sites

It evaluates the effects of mutations by comparing predictions for mutated and unmutated sequences, providing a direct readout of potential functional consequences.

The architecture combines convolutional layers (to detect local patterns), transformers (to model long-range dependencies), and final modality-specific layers, distributing training across interconnected TPUs for efficiency.

AlphaGenome builds on DeepMind’s previous model, Enformer, and complements AlphaMissense, extending variant-effect prediction from protein-coding regions (2% of the genome) to the vast non-coding regions that shape gene regulation.

#### 🌱 Why this is exciting
It seems like integration of 3D and multi-scale genomic information is becoming essential for decoding gene regulation and variant effects. AlphaGenome is a step toward that vision, offering:

✅ A scalable, open-access tool for the research community\\
✅ Potential insights into disease mechanisms\\
✅ Foundations for new therapeutic discoveries

By making AlphaGenome available via API, DeepMind is inviting the community to explore and validate this model, accelerating our collective progress in interpreting the genome’s language.

With a dual background in pharmacy and computational biology, I focus on integrating pharmacological insight with machine learning to tackle a core challenge in drug discovery and precision medicine: extracting actionable knowledge from complex, high-dimensional, and often sparse biomedical data.

My research centers on developing knowledge-aware computational frameworks—including patient-specific gene regulatory modeling, graph-based learning, and multi-modal molecular representation—to improve therapeutic prediction, compound prioritization, and drug-likeness evaluation. These efforts prioritize model interpretability, translational generalizability, and the principled incorporation of domain knowledge into data-driven systems.

<!-- Hi! I'm Dohoon Lee. 
I got my Ph.D. from the Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics at the Seoul National University, South Korea, as a member of [Bio & Health Informatics Lab](https://bhi-kimlab.github.io) advised by professor Sun Kim. 
Before that I got my bachelor's degree from the School of Biological Sciences at the Seoul National University, with a minor in Computer Science.

My research interests include **computational epigenomics**, especially the analysis of DNA methylation patterns within normal and malignant cells.
I am deeply curious how the extent of errors in the somatic inheritance of DNA methylation states are systematically controlled.
Recently, I am excited to examine the potential of **deep learning** architectures for the modeling of the complex interactions among chromatin features.
I believe such AI-driven approaches will certainly be a new paradigm to pursue unbiased and novel scientific findings in a near future.

Besides, I also care about the reproducibility of research results and reusable analysis procedures. I implement it by modularizing routine analyses as self-contained analysis pipelines with workflow management tools, especially with snakemake!

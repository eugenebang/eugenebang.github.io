With a dual background in pharmacy and computational biology, I focus on integrating pharmacological insight with machine learning to tackle a core challenge in drug discovery and precision medicine: extracting actionable knowledge from complex, high-dimensional, and often sparse biomedical data.

My research centers on developing **knowledge-aware computational frameworks**—including patient-specific gene regulatory modeling, graph-based learning, and multi-modal molecular representation—to improve therapeutic prediction, compound prioritization, and drug-likeness evaluation. These efforts prioritize model interpretability, translational generalizability, and the principled incorporation of domain knowledge into data-driven systems.

Besides, I also care about the reproducibility of research results and reusable analysis procedures. I implement it by modularizing routine analyses as self-contained analysis pipelines with workflow management tools, especially with snakemake!

✅ [One paper on ATP binding site prediction accepted by *JCIM*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01255)\\
✅ [One paper on toxicity prediction accepted by *JCI*](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-025-01012-5)

It seems like **integration of 3D information is becoming essential** for advancing these tasks. 🧩

Huge congratulations to my amazing co-first authors and mentees, **Jaechan Lee** and **Sumin Ha**, for their great work! 👏
